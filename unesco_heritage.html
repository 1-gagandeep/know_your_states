It was the meeting place of many religions (Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Jainism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Judaism), which resulted in a unique urban fabric. The architecture is based on timber, and the typical neighbourhoods are called pols, densely packed traditional houses with gated streets. Important buildings from the Sultanate period include the Bhadra Fort city walls, Sidi Saiyyed Mosque (pictured) and numerous mosques, tombs, and shrines.</td>

The villages mix urban and rural influences, both Tamil and those from a broader region, as a result of the travels of the merchants in Southeast Asia. Thousands of palatial houses were built using local and imported materials. The most recent ones, built in the 1930s and 1940s, are in the Art Deco style.
